# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering and Elbow Method

This repository contains code and resources for performing customer segmentation using K-means clustering and the elbow method. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better by grouping them into categories based on similarities, allowing for targeted marketing and personalized services.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on the **Mall Customers** dataset, available on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers](link_to_dataset_on_kaggle). The dataset contains information about customers such as their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Visualize relationships between different features to gain insights.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Handle missing values if any.
- Scale the numerical features if necessary.

### 3. K-means Clustering
- Implement K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their features.
- Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 4. Interpretation
- Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment identified by K-means clustering.
- Interpret and visualize the results to understand meaningful customer segments.

## Files

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for the analysis.
- `mall_customers.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
3. Run `customer_segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## Results

- Discuss insights gained from the segmentation analysis.
- Present visualizations and summaries of the customer segments.
- Discuss potential business implications and next steps based on the findings.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation using K-means clustering and the elbow method is a powerful technique for businesses to gain actionable insights from their customer data. This project demonstrates the application of these methods on the Mall Customers dataset, providing a foundation for further analysis and decision-making.
